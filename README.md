# autodiff-benchmarks

Small test program to compare autodiff libraries. At the moment these libraries are:

* [autodiff](https://github.com/autodiff/autodiff/)
* [Adept-2](https://github.com/rjhogan/Adept-2)
* [ADOL-C](https://github.com/coin-or/ADOL-C)

The test transforms an input-vector by a few matrices to an output-vector, of which then the jacobian is computed.
